### Professional Portfolio Mockup ###

***PURPOSE***
The following is a professional portfolio mockup, that is set-up to be easily updated as more projects get completed, or changes are made to anything. 

***Summary***
The following porfolio, has been set up to support my, Morgan Holcombs, work. It is mostly filled with mock-up's and filler text, however, as I complete more projects, I will be able to plug them in with ease. 


**Change Projects out**

**Change Color Theme**

I added some roots so that the colors and theme of the page are easy to change as needed.

**Utilize Media queiries**

I implemented media query, so the page moves with more ease, and production when switching between different device sizes.

**Utilize Flex Box**

I implemented flex boxes and css grid, to maintain the structure, even when adding more information, so everything can move and flow more responsively when the screen size is adjusted/changed.
